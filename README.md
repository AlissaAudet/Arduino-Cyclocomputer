### Circuit Components

    1x Arduino Uno

    1x Ultrasonic distance sensor

    1x Red, 112 (0x70) 7-segment clock display

    1x push-buttons

    Breadboard + jumper wires

## How It Works
The code uses a constant representing the circumference of the bike wheel.
Typically, a cyclometer detects each wheel rotation using a magnet. In this simulation, the ultrasonic sensor replaces that mechanism. When the detected distance crosses a specific threshold (simulating a spoke passing in front of the sensor), the distance and speed variables are updated.

    Distance is cumulative, increasing by the wheelâ€™s circumference on each detection.

    Speed is calculated using the time between two rotations (in m/s).

    The ultrasonic sensor works by emitting a sound wave and calculating the distance based on the time it takes for the echo to return, using the speed of sound.

    A button is used to switch between displaying speed and distance

### State Management

Several variables are used 
      
    totalDistance: keeps track of the total distance traveled by the bike.
    
    speed: current speed of the bike, calculated from the time between two rotations.
    
    lastRotationTime: stores the time when the last wheel rotation was detected, used for speed calculation.
    
    spokePreviouslyDetected: helps detect state changes by remembering if the spoke was already detected.
    
    displaySpeed: toggles the display between distance and speed modes when the button is pressed.
    
    lastButtonPress: records the last time the button was pressed, used for debouncing.
    
    debounceDelay: sets the minimum delay between valid button presses to filter out bouncing.
    
    lastButtonState: remembers the previous state of the button to detect rising or falling edges for clean toggles.    
                                                        
## What I learned

    I learned how to use an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance and internal pull-up resistor to detect input from button.

### Challenge I encountered:

    Button input was prone to bugs due to bouncing and false triggers. 
    Solution:
    In most cases, buttons are read with HIGH as the default state, but in this project, I used the internal pull-up resistor, so a button press pulls the pin LOW instead.
    This avoids floating inputs but makes the logic slightly more complex to implement correctly.

### Possible Improvements

    The display is limited to 4 digits, so the total distance cannot go beyond 999 meters. 
    One possible solution would be to switch units dynamically or use a larger display module to support more digits.
